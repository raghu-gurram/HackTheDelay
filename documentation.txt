| Heuristic                                                     | Delay Reason      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Speed = 0 for > 10 min                                        | Extended Stop     |
| Slow movement near known busy locations                       | Traffic Jam       |
| Stop matches a rest point in schedule                         | Bio Break         |
| Multiple points logged at same location with > threshold time | Operational Delay |
| Very late at one stop, but fine before                        | Upstream Cascade  |

| ⏱ Delay Classification     | Use ML to predict delay reasons from GPS data                                             |
| 📍 Traffic Hotspots        | Use clustering (e.g., DBSCAN) to find locations where delays are common                   |
| 🔮 Future Delay Prediction | Build models using past data to predict delays                                            |
| 📊 Visualization           | Build a dashboard (Streamlit/Dash) with maps, tables, trip segments, delay visualizations |
| 🗺 Google Maps Integration | Optional: Plot delay points using Google Maps API or Folium                               |

4.50pm - cleaned the vechicle gps data , add start and end time stamps
